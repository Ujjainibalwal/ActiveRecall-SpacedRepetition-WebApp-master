# ActiveRecall-SpacedRepetition-WebApp-master
🧠 Project Description: ActiveRecall-SpacedRepetition-WebApp-master (SuperMemo 2 Algorithm)
Overview
A web application designed to revolutionize your studying with an implementation of Active Recall and Spaced Repetition, powered by the efficient SuperMemo 2 (SM-2) algorithm. This tool helps users maximize retention and recall efficiency by dynamically scheduling review sessions based on their performance, moving away from rigid, time-based study methods.

Key Features
⚡️ SuperMemo 2 (SM-2) Algorithm Integration: At the core of the application, SM-2 calculates the optimal next review date for each item (e.g., flashcard or concept). The algorithm adjusts the repetition interval (I) and ease factor (EF) based on the user's grading of their recall quality.

✍️ Active Recall Focus: Promotes testing effect by requiring users to actively retrieve information (e.g., answering a question or defining a term) before revealing the solution, ensuring deeper learning.

📅 Dynamic Scheduling: Review sessions are automatically generated, presenting the user with the items that are most critical to review at that specific moment (right before they are likely to forget).

📊 Performance Grading: Users grade their recall on a scale (typically 0-5 or similar) after attempting an item, directly feeding into the SM-2 calculation.

💻 Responsive Web Interface: A clean, intuitive, and responsive design for a smooth experience across desktop and mobile devices.

💾 Item Management: Functionality to create, edit, and categorize study items (e.g., flashcards, facts, Q&A pairs).

🔒 User Authentication (Planned/Implemented): Secure login and personalized study data storage.
